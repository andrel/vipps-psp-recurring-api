# Vipps PSP Version 2 Recurring API

This repository contains developer resources for the Vipps PSP Recurring API.

The Vipps PSP Recurring API enables the integration of recurring payments for a PSP. The PSP recurring functionality is built as an extension to the already used PSPv2 API.

Please see [Getting Started](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md) for information about API keys, product activation, etc.

See the [Vipps Developers repository](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers) for contact information, contribution guidelines, etc.

As the recurring extension builds upon PSPv2, the [PSPv2 Guide](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-psp-api/blob/master/vipps-psp-api.md) still apllies.
